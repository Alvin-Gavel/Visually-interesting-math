This is a repository where I put mathematically interesting things that also happen to look visually interesting. Each directory contains one module and one demonstration script which shows how to use the module.

The current contents of the repository are:

`README.md`: This text

`requirements.txt`: File listing the Python modules that must be installed to run the code in this repository, and which versions it was tested on.

`Fractals`: Fractals, such as the Mandelbrot set.

`Spirographs`: The patterns generated by following a point on a wheel rolling within a larger wheel.

`Star_polygons`: The general type of shape that pentagrams and David's stars are examples of.

`Ulam_spiral`: The strange pattern that appears when writing integers in a spiral and then colouring the ones that are primes.
