This is a repository where I put mathematically interesting things that also happen to look visually interesting.

The current contents of the repository are:

`README.md`: This text

`fractals.py`: A module for plotting fractals, such as the Mandelbrot set.

`fractals_test_script.py`: A script demonstrating how to use the module.

`star_polygons.py`: A module for plotting star polygons. That is, the general type of shape that pentagrams and David's stars are examples of.

`star_polygons_test_script.py`: A script demonstrating how to use the module.
